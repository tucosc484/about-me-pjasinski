## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class? ##
I've been programming/using computers since I was a child. I've been using Linux on and off since middle school and really enjoy programming low level hardware stuff. I helped write a driver for the Gamecube Controller Adapter. I've written Java and C++ applications too. I've done almost nothing with networking and web development at all. Most of my interest have always been at the Operating System level. I took this class to get the expierence with web development, specifically with stuff like AWS, Node.js and technologies like that. I have a pretty big gaping whole in my knowledge of those technolgies that you can't escape now, hopefully we cover some of that stuff

## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?  ##
In terms of career, I actually have already accepted a postiion at Oracle as a Implementation Consultant with their Food & Beverage POS product called Simphony. I start that job in March and they are willing to work with me with my school load. That really was my dream position because I love working in restaurants and hospitality, and I'm lucky to have such a great oppurtunity. I hope to climb the corporate ladder with this job and make my way to some sort of director position.

## What programming expierence do you have? Do you have any web experience? ##
I have almost no web expierence besides understanding basic HTML stuff. CSS is like gibberish to me also. Everytime I've tried to get into web, I've lost motivation. Hopefully this class gives me the kick in the butt I need to finally learn how to build a decent website to be hosted.
